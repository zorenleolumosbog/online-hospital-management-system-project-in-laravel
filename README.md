# Online Hospital Management System using Laravel

An integrated information system for managing all areas of a hospital’s operations, including medical, financial, administrative, legal, and compliance, is known as an online hospital management system. Electronic health records, corporate intelligence, and revenue cycle management are all included. Using hospital management systems, hospitals and healthcare institutions can increase the quality of healthcare services, lower operating costs, and improve the revenue cycle. This project is written in Laravel and uses MySQL as its database.

The Laravel Online Hospital Management System is a straightforward project built with PHP-Laravel, JavaScript, and CSS. There are admin and user sides of the project. The admin side is in charge of everything, including handling doctors’ records, patient records, appointment times, treatment facilities, and so on. The administrator plays a crucial role in the administration of this online hospital management system.

Users in the user section might be either patients or doctors. As a doctor, the user can check their appointments, patients, and timings, among other things. Similarly, in order to log in as a patient, the user must have their hospital login id and password. If they do not have them, the patient must first register as a new patient. The patient can access information such as appointment times, medication data, and treatment records.
